Below are the current limitations of AltInput.

Since my development time is limited, I currently have no plans to remove the
following limitations (but you are welcome to send a patch to address them).

* Windows ONLY:
- Relies on SharpDX, which is a Windows only library
- Relies on WritePrivateProfileString/GetPrivateProfileString, which are
  Windows kernel32.dll APIs

* Device must be a DirectInput controller.
  Other methods of querying input are not supported.

* Device must belong to DirectInput 'GameControl class. 
  Other DirectInput devices are not supported.

* No UI to assign the controls - everything must be set through the ini file.

* No EVA or camera control.
  From what I could see, handling EVA/camera controls means going through
  vector transformations and other time consumming stuff.
  If you want to figure that one, I'll accept a patch!
