Below are the current limitations of AltInput.

Because my development time is limited, I am not planning to work on removing
these limitations.

Of course, you are very welcome to send a patch if you want to tackle them.

* Windows ONLY:
- Relies on SharpDX which is Windows only
- Relies on WritePrivateProfileString/GetPrivateProfileString kernel32.dll APIs

* Device must be a DirectInput controller. Other methods of querying input are
  not supported.

* Device must belong to the DirectInput GameControl class. Other DirectInput
  devices are not supported.

* Camera control, cycling through ships, switch view and so on are not supported

* No UI to assign the controls - everything must be set through the ini file.
